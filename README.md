Hello everyone!!!

This is the initial application for exchanging data between
a weather station (based on an Arduino microcontroller)and a home PC.
I used asynchronous functions of the Boost::asio library for asynchronous data exchange between the client and the server.
In the future, more functionality will be added to the app(how to " drive " data between the client and the server,
multithreading, etc.)
